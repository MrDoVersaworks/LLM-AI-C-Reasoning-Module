LLM-AI C++ Reasoning Module
Overview
The LLM-AI C++ Reasoning Module is an AI-powered system that integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide contextual reasoning and decision-making support for automated systems.
Features
•	AI-Powered Reasoning: Uses GPT-4 to analyze and provide recommendations.
•	Seamless OpenAI API Integration: Connects with OpenAI's API for real-time responses.
•	JSON Handling: Utilizes jsoncpp for structured data management.
•	Secure API Communication: Uses libcurl for HTTP requests.
Tech Stack
•	C++
•	OpenAI API (GPT-4)
•	libcurl (HTTP Requests)
•	JsonCpp (JSON Processing)
Installation
Prerequisites
•	C++ Compiler (GCC or Clang)
•	libcurl (sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev)
•	JsonCpp (sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev)

Build the Project
g++ -o llm_ai_reasoning main.cpp -lcurl -ljsoncpp
Run the Program
./llm_ai_reasoning
Usage
1. Providing a Problem Statement
The program prompts the user to enter a reasoning query. Example:
Enter a problem statement for reasoning: How can AI optimize supply chain management?
2. Processing the Input
•	The request is sent to OpenAI's API.
•	The AI processes the input and generates a contextual response.
3. Receiving the AI Response
Example Output:
AI Response: AI can optimize supply chain management through predictive analytics, automated decision-making, and real-time tracking.
API Configuration
To use the OpenAI API, update OPENAI_API_KEY in main.cpp:
#define OPENAI_API_KEY "your_openai_api_key"
